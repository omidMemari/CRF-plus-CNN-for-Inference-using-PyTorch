DNN-vs-CRF.py:
code for own designed CNN that is a simplified version of AlexNet. 
Makes the prediction and finds accuracy for training and test using different optimizers like L-BFGS and Adam.

conv.py:
Code for single convolution layer.

conv_test:
Code to test convolution layer using pytorch conv2d function.

crf.py:
Code for CRF layer. It includes implementation of forward propagation, backward propagation and loss for crf.

data_loader.py:
Data loader code as provided by Professor.

train.py
Code to train the neural network with one/two conv layer and crf as nn.module layer.
